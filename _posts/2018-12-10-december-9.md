ChristmasEvangelism_!_

I made a derogatory statement about a "sinner" the other day to one of my friends. He responded with something like "why would you hold her to your standards or convictions? She's not even a Christian."

He was right. This celebrity is not a follower of Christ, as far as I know. Why should I expect her to live like I believe?

And I'm all game to tell Christians "Remember, Jesus is the reason for the season." In fact, my mind drifts back to a [cantata][0] my parent's sang in. My Dad had a tenor solo in it. I can still remember his delight in doing the octave slide at the end of it.

So why are we compelled to hold non followers of Christ to the true meaning of Christmas?

Is it the same feeling I get holding "the world" to the traditional biblical model of marriage? Like you can do whatever you want do, just don't call it marriage? Celebrate this season however you want, just don't call it Christmas? So maybe, "happy holidays" is actually better?

I'm really not looking for a fight, I'm just trying to figure out why we feel compelled to "fix people's perspectives about the TRUE meaning of Christmas."

As I think about this though, there's a bit too much parallel for comfort here. In the same way that there is often too little distinction between a Christian marriage, and a non-Christian one (or Christian or non-Christian "committed homosexual relationship"), how differently do Christian households celebrate Advent and the "Christmas season" than the unbelieving world around us?

Can we name 10 things that we do differently? How about 5?

And I feel like we have to go beyond just saying "well, we're different because we know the true meaning behind it." That feels weak. If the practices are the same, just the heart is different, that leaves me wanting more.

I want a marked difference between the folks that just "do Christmas" and those who follow Jesus and celebrate the birth.

I no longer think that I need to "hold them to our beliefs" when it comes to ChristmasEvangelism. Absolutely we must have a reason for the hope that we have and know winsome ways of talking about its meaning. But the hard sell, the condescending tone, let's stop it, I'd say.
