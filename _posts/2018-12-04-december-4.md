There's no other element of Christmas more quintessential than its MUSIC.

And this Amy Grant album is it for me. Always has been. Now it came out at the same time my family moved from Costa Rica to the scary world of the States. We crash landed in New Jersey for six terrible months, before gliding into a great 14 year season in San Antonio, Texas.

And this music was the soundtrack.

Ah a soundtrack for a season. Like a movie, the music of Christmas unifies and divides us. Well, that's probably only true if you're a worship leader. Then you hear ALL people's expectations as they thrust upon you the songs you must include to avoid ruining their Christmas.

I hate that pressure.

But it's undeniable. The season has a soundtrack.

There's a lot of good music.

And there's a lot of music.

In fact, though I'm listening to the aforementioned Christmas album as I type this in MOD Pizza, I'm being much more guarded this year about what I listen to. Because I feel like I've missed so much of what we are to celebrate, that I want to avoid being swept into it.

I'm not one to censor things, but I'm just trying to capture the HOLY essence, and that means blocking everything else out.

The idea of fuzzy antlers on Rudolph's head, snowball fights, pumpkin pie shared by family, a star atop the Christmas tree, Santa's sleigh, all the lore...I just need it to stop for a bit so I can focus!

So for this year, I'm trying to be vigilant. And I want to listen to the songs through a biblical narrative. Where is the story of Jesus? Where is the Anticipation of His arrival, not of Christmas morning!
