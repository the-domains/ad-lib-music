## Wish Lists.

We do this you know. We make and receive wish lists. For gifts.

I can't help but wish that I'd know people well enough to not have to ask for their wish list. And I get it. Decades of jokes come from re-gifting things and there's a whole demographic of people that seems to have a disproportionately low success rate in finding gifts that "stick."

What if I didn't buy anything for anybody that I didn't know so well, I could just pick something because he/she would love it. Shoot, Amazon seems to know me that well, right!?

And I'm not talking about how we feel as parents when loving relatives buy more 48-piece toys for our children. There's already stuff all over their floors (read: they already have more things than they are able to care for.)

But gift giving is FUN! And I'm a gifts person (from a Love Language perspective), so I love receiving gifts too.

But as a parent of six beautiful people under 13, the time to linger, browse, shop, ponder, consider, bargain-hunt, etc. just doesn't exist. Neither does the budget for that matter.

So year after year, I'm frustrated...that we get too much stuff, or I don't get the right stuff, or we did a gift exchange and I only gave one gift and received one gift...boy that's a lot of pressure!! ONE GIFT, that's it man. You're whole Christmas experience is wrapped up in this single person's ability to pick the right gift, the (as the advertisements go) "perfect gift."

Before my mind wanders to the real Perfect Gift and I Jesus juke this moment, what do I really think?

Honestly, I'm having one of those moments where you base your expectations on what you experienced as children and not on the Story.

I remember (mostly by the scanned slides I have) of happy Christmases. Even as missionaries in Costa Rica, where I spent my first eleven Christmases. Presents from grandparents, home-built treasures from my Dad's workshop, and special "big" toys/bikes/train sets.

So what trips me up about the gifts culture? (And I'm not really addressing the commercialization. That's it's own manure performance.)

I mean, my thought process for "why we do gifts" in the first place usually goes:

God modeled this for us by giving us Jesus as a gift - the gift of salvation. We are to love each other, and gifts are a tangible way to demonstrate this. Oh, the wise men, of course, they brought gifts...but those were for the baby Jesus.

But what really trips me up? No time, no money to do it like I'd like to? That's where I'll leave it for today.

So why do we give each other gifts?
