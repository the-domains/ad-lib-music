# December 3

Christmas Morning!

Sure, it was staged...in classic Dad format - timer on the camera.

I think that the way we "do" Christmas Morning is...off.

> Hurry now, wake up your eyes. Time for little ones to see, Daddy's got a big surprise hiding underneath the Christmas tree.

If we have to "reinterpret" a moment or a tradition so that it has meaning, is that something we want to keep?

So the kids get up first because, well duh. Then they attack their stockings, which for our family is a piece of fruit, some small gifts, maybe some gum.

Then the asking begins. "Can we open presents yet?!?"

I remember that. I want to open presents too! But wait...first we have to read the Christmas story so that our paper-tearing frenzy has some MEANING.

Ew.

I don't think I'm just dealing with "life with small children." As parents, we are the leaders here. We can create whatever culture we feel is best. Doesn't matter if the culture around us is different.

The tradition/rhythm/expectation/culture we create must be compelling, worship-inspiring, family-strengthening.

But first, why the feasting - food and gifts. Why is that what is expected? Because Jesus' gift is so lavish that we have to respond in kind?

I feel like I'm honestly doing a pretty terrible job of deconstruction. But it's only day three.
