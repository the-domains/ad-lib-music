# December 11

Are you ready for Christmas?

What does that even mean? It certainly isn't usually in reference to my heart's posture and preparedness to celebrate Emmanuel. It means:

* Did you finish your gift shopping?
* Did you plan the menu?
* Did you decorate the house?
* Did you schedule the events?
* Did you finish your tasks at work so you can take some vacation days?

But did my heart prepare Him room? How do you even do that in Advent to prepare for Christmas?
