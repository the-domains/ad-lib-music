Santa Clause

Don't hate the old man. Or his memory. Saint Nicholas was a saint after all.

But I want to reject the whole storyline of Christian parents being Santa Clause. **Where did our distinction go?** It would be appropriate for our children to have a wildly different narrative and expectation than their non-Christian schoolmates. Not in the "holier than thou" way, just in the "a whole different kind of wonder" way.

Like two cultures meeting. Our kids would say "Tell me about your Santa Clause," full of wonder and curiosity. And then they can tell them about our "Baby Jesus in a manger - a King that came in weakness and poverty."

Wouldn't that be better?
