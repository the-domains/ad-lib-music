A very special Christmas...the one-upsmanship that crushingly oppresses

> And this Christmas, will be 
> A very special Christmas, for me

Maybe you know the [Donny Hathaway song][0] I learned last Christmas. It rolls round and round in my head, carving the expectation: the best of all Christmases will be this Christmas!

What if it's not?

Have a holly, jolly Christmas, it's the best time of the year

It's the most wonderful time of the year

It's the hap-happiest season of all

Simply having a wonderful Christmas time

Have yourself a merry little Christmas, let your heart be light

Now I know those are not the Christmas hymns that know as beloved carols, but they are what we hear everywhere we go. And they get stuck in your head.

But beyond the songs, the movies, your childhood, and every single commercial, I'm expected to have the best, the most fun, the most meaningful, the wonderfullest Christmas EVER! Every year. That pressure is for the birds. No thank you!

Now as an Enneagram 7, I'm always anticipating the next great thing. Ever searching for what my last search only temporarily satisfied. And I'll own that dysfunction.

But what if I looked forward to this Christmas, not with this air of an unsustainable month-long magical Christmas season, but as a season of Advent, of anticipating the celebration of an arrival? And expected the day itself to be holy yet ordinary, special yet simple, shared and present?
