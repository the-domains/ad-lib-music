# December 10

"Do Christmas"

This phrase gets me. "When are we going to do Christmas?"

We use it for talking about family gatherings, and specifically for "opening presents."

As children, this is certainly the pinnacle. As children.

And to be fair, we do have a lot of children in our families. But it still feels...over-emphasized.

As I think about what we do on Christmas Day, our tradition is usually:

1. Wake up tired because we were wrapping presents until late at night
2. Children open their stockings (orange, peppermint stick, small toy)
3. Get up and make breakfast - maybe a coffee cake - and beat off children's repeated requests to open presents.
4. Eat breakfast, antsilly.
5. Move to the living room.
6. Look for the Christmas story in the bible.
7. Heather has the kids act it out as I read it.
8. Avoid the flurry of ripping by insisting that only one present gets opened at a time, with a tiny break between each so we can appreciate the gift.
9. Clean up.
10. Fight over toys, argue with each other, and do whatever we want the rest of the day, as long as it's inclusive of the whole 0-12 age range of the kids.

Ew.

I wonder if there's even a "service order" for the Christ-Mass? I really, really want something more holy than our tradition includes.
