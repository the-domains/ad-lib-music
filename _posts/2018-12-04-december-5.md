# December 5

"Merry Christmas."

The practice of greeting someone with Merry Christmas feels nostalgically 1920's. There's such warmth to it. It's just cheery.

But in post-I-don't-want-to-say-Obama-but-Obama-US, I feel this silent cheer from many Christians when someone says Merry Christmas instead of Happy Holidays. And sometimes someone starts with Happy Holidays, and when the other person says Merry Christmas, they act "freed" and respond again with a head-cocked, glistened-eye "yes, Merry Christmas."

_And I feel the pressure to respond that way. Like it's my Christian duty, like I'm letting down the church if I don't, like I'm missing an opportunity to witness if I don't._

Sheesh, that's some pressure!

Part of it is that I don't like to follow rules. I also bristle strongly at "having to" say "the Lord is risen indeed" on Easter when someone says "The Lord is risen."

Now, of course, I could shut up, go with the flow, hear the intended heart behind the greeting or farewell and just say Merry Christmas (which I do), but I die a little when I do that.

Why?

Is it that I feel that the person saying it doesn't really experience the core, Emmanuel God with us? And it cheapens it?

Is it that I don't believe they are actually merry and that their Christmas gatherings and day are shallow and fraught with artificial relationships and gluttony? (boy, that was honestly dark)

Is it that _I_ am not experiencing the merriness of Christmas and am jealous of those who seem to have a storybook experience?

Maybe that's the most honest one. Like when someone says Merry Christmas, I'd like to say back "not really...'disappointing Christmas' is more accurate." So it that it? I'm disappointed and so I don't want people ruining my pity party?

But I'm not a scrooge. I want to have a really wonderful time. Part of why I don't is that we don't eat the things that we used to. We deal with some severe allergies in our family, so everything is modified or avoided altogether.

Oh, so food is tied to happiness, merriness, celebration. Not to be too hard on myself, but man.

So my prayer in this day is **to be satisfied and filled with joy firstly and mostly by Himself**. Otherwise it's like I'm complaining to everyone at a wedding because I don't like the music or the food.
