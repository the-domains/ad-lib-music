"...with every Christmas Card I write..."

Truth be told, we've always wanted to send out pictures of our family with updates of how we're all doing. We at least mention it to each other every year. But we have yet to do it. Even once in our 13 years of marriage. 0 for 13\.

I love seeing them. How families change and kids grow.

I love the recap of the year. Highlights and lowlights. Wins and losses. It's like a paper version of a facebook summary. But way better.

The Hacketts win Best Card Award for their whacky photoshopped cards every year. But there's always a blessing to the reader amongst the updates.

It helps us learn and remember the names of our friends' children. And it's amazing to see how many have large families like ours.

It reminds us the we have community, even when we don't always feel like we do. In fact, we keep them up all year and just replace the old ones with the updated ones.

As much as we love receiving them, there's this tinge of guilt that we've never reciprocated. Though we always want to. What keeps us from engaging in this tradition. Sometimes money, always time, and sure planning. I don't know that this year looks any different.
